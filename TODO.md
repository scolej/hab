# Things to be done

## Broken

When you level up, the report shows negative marks for your
experience.

## To improve

It would be nice if it could be always assumed that the character
modification list was always sorted in date order. The order of this
list is currently not defined and is causing bugs. Extract the
GameState type and provide a better constructor?

"1 item(s) checked off" ?? you can do better than this! Conditional "s"!
