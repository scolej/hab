# Things to be done

## Broken

You can still mark off items even when you are dead.

## To improve

CharMods are now sorted in date order but the order is not defined for
mods which coincide.

Flag to output as JSON, then write tests which test the entire
program?

There are a lot of incomplete pattern matches on the character state.
Maybe this suggests that there should be a type for the state which
does not include the death state.

## Ideas

Finish level with full health bonus. Maybe start the next level with
+10% experience.
